<h2>How To Compete</h2>
<p>Download the client library <a href="/static/script-wars-client.jar">here</a>. 
It needs to be added to the classpath when you run your AI code. Pick a game to play from the list above. Use the functions in the Network class documented 
<a href="/doc/brownshome/scriptwars/client/Network.html">here</a>, or a specific game API, if it exists, to create an AI. Request an ID from the game page and use it in
the connect function as shown in the documentation. Compile your code with javac and run it.</p>
        
<p>Use <code>Network.connect(ID, "52.65.69.217", 35565, "John Smith");</code> to connect to the server.</p>
